# Reproducing published results on paraboloid-polytope intersection

This document explains how to reproduce the results presented in our journal paper on paraboloid-polytope intersection, published in the SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing [link](). A preprint of this article is available in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.07772.pdf) as well as in the [current repository](manuscript_paraboloid_intersection.pdf).
## Unit cube translation (Section 7.1)

In order to reproduce Figures 5 and 6 of the [paper](), it is necessary to build the unit tests of IRL (for which the option `-D BUILD_TESTING=ON` must be provided when building IRL itself). This requires executing the additional command:

```
make irl_test
```

Once the unit tests have been built, the paraboloid-polyhedron intersections shown in Figure 5 of the [paper]() can be generated by executing:

```
./tests/bin/irl_test --gtest_filter=ParaboloidIntersection.SISCPaperFig5
```

This will generate a set of STL files which can be viewed with most visualization softwares (e.g., [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/)). The files used to generate Figure 5 of  the [paper]() are:
```
clipped_surface_*.stl
unclipped_cube_*.stl
```
resulting in the following visualizations:
|<img src="./figures/figure5a.png" style="max-width:30%; object-fit: contain;"/>|<img src="./figures/figure5b.png" style="max-width:30%; object-fit: contain;"/>|<img src="./figures/figure5c.png" style="max-width:30%; object-fit: contain;"/>|

|Fig. 5a|Fig. 5b|Fig. 5c|

The exact moments and estimation errors plotted in Figure 6 of the [paper]() can be generated by executing:
```
./tests/bin/irl_test --gtest_filter=ParaboloidIntersection.SISCPaperFig6
```

This produces a text file named `fig6.txt` containing the raw data (i.e., the *unscaled* moments and associated estimation errors) used for generating the plots in Figure 6, shown here:

|<img src="./figures/figure6a.png" style="max-width:30%; object-fit: contain;"/>|<img src="./figures/figure6b.png" style="max-width:30%; object-fit: contain;"/>|
