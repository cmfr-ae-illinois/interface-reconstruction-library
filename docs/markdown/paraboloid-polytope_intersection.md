# Reproducing our published results on paraboloid-polytope intersection

We explain here how to reproduce the results presented in our [paper]() on paraboloid-polytope intersection.

## Unit cube translation (Section 7.1)

In order to reproduce Figures 5 and 6 of the [paper](), it is necessary to build the unit tests of IRL (for which the option `-D BUILD_TESTING=ON` must be provided when building IRL itself). This requires executing the additional command:

```
make irl_test
```

Once the unit tests have been built, the clipped cubes shown in Figure 5 of the [paper]() can be generated by executing:

```
./tests/bin/irl_test --gtest_filter=ParaboloidIntersection.SISCPaperFig5
```

This will generate a set of STL files that can be visualized using most visualization softwares (e.g., [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/)). The files used to generate Figure 5 of  the [paper]() are:
```
clipped_surface_*.stl
unclipped_cube_*.stl
```
